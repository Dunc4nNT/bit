    About us

  <h3>
    Why we made this website
  </h3>
  <p>
  This website is made as an assignment to teach ourselves how to implement existing bio-informatics tools and make them more accessible in the form of a website.<br>
  The choice for the tool eventually came down to WGD because of its promising use in analysing, dating and visualising DNA duplication events.<br>
  For information about WGD visit the background reading page.
